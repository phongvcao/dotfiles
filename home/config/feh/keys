# In place editing - rotate the images 90 degrees (counter)clock‐
# wise.  The rotation is lossless, but may create artifacts in some
# image corners when used with JPEG images.	Rotating in the
# reverse direction will make them go away.	See jpegtran(1) for
# more about lossless JPEG rotation.	 Note: jpegtran does not
# update EXIF orientation tags. However, feh assumes that you use
# the feature to normalize image orientation and want it to be dis‐
# played this way everywhere. After every rotation, it will uncon‐
# ditionally set the EXIF orientation to 1 ("0,0 is top left").
# Should you need to reverse this, see jpegexiforient(1).

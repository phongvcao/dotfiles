The following tutorial is on how to keep DuckDNS domain entry updated when using
a Dynamic IP ISP provider (e.g. Comcast):

1. Step 1: Edit /etc/ddclient.conf file:
# /etc/ddclient.conf
protocol=duckdns, \
password='token-content' \
ip='your ip as detected by `what is my ip`' \
duckdns_domain_name (e.g. as in duckdns_domain_name.duckdns.org)

2. Step 2: Edit /etc/default/ddclient file:
# /etc/default/ddclient
run_dhclient="false"
run_ipup="false"
run_daemon="true"
daemon_interval="300"

3. Step 3: Try running sudo ddclient to see if it succeeds:
$ sudo ddclient
SUCCESS:  updating @: good: IP address set to 45.123.789.13

4. Step 4: Run ddclient as a service:
sudo service ddclient restart

5. Step 5: Check if ddclient is already active as a service:
sudo service ddclient status

1. Move /config/home-assistant_v2.db to separate folder to reduce Google Drive Backup Snapshot size:
   # First, Enable SSH to HASS.IO RPi 4B Server

   $ ssh root@hassio.local

   ~$ mkdir /media/database/

   # Now, STOP HASS Server under Configuration -> Server Controls

   ~$ mv /config/home-assistant_v2.db /media/database/

   ~$ ln -s /media/database/home-assistant_v2.db /config/home-assistant_v2.db

   ~$ sudo reboot

   # Finally, Disable SSH to HASS.IO RPi 4B Server

2. Install ArgonOne Active Cooling Add-on and HassOS I2C Configurator Add-on.

3. When there's issues with custom_components, just delete the /config/custom_components/
folder entirely (since originally it was not there), and HASS would probably work
just fine without custom_components.

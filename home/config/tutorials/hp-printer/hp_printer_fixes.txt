1. Paper Setup for HP Printer (to fix Cleaning while Printing issue)

Go to system setup

Go to Paper setup, then paper type (tray 1 and 2)

Switch paper type for both to heavy

 

 

Go back to paper setup - then go into Paper out action

Change this setting to Overide

 

The pages may print out a little slower, but they'll print out without having to worry about that cleaning issue constantly.

1. Setup OpeNVPN Server for Dynamic DNS on TP-Link Routers:

- NOTE: We should keep 2 x separate OpenVPN Certificate: 1 with Direct IP Address access & the other
with No-IP Domain Indirect Access. For privacy purposes, we should mainly use Direct IP Address access.
However, when that fails, we fall back to using the No-IP Domain Indirect Access to export a Direct-IP
OpenVPN client-to-server certificate again to replace the old Direct-IP certificate OUTDATED by ISP
provider.

- For TP-Link router, first we have to register No-IP account. Then we have to register our own domain.

- After this, enter the credentials of No-IP Domain into the Dynamic DNS section of TP-Link Router configuration.

- Then we export the OpenVPN certificate, open the certificate with a text editor (Vim, TextEdit, etc.),
replacing the Public IP Address (e.g. 123.456.78.9) of the TP-Link router with the No-IP Domain Name
(e.g. my_no_ip_domain.ddns.net).

- Now the certificate is ready to be used and should never be OUTDATED/DYNAMICALLY CHANGED by ISP provider.

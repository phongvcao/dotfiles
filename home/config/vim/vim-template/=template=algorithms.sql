/*
 * Here's the basic syntax for creating a table in MySQL:
 *
 *     table_name is the name of the table you want to create
 *
 *     column1, column2, column3, etc. are the names of the columns in the table
 *
 *     datatype is the data type of the column
 *
 *     constraints can include any additional constraints, such as NOT NULL,
 *     DEFAULT, etc.
 * 
 *     PRIMARY KEY creates a primary key constraint on the specified column(s)
 *
 *     UNIQUE creates a unique constraint on the specified column(s)
 *
 *     CHECK creates a check constraint on the specified column(s)
 *
 *     FOREIGN KEY creates a foreign key constraint on the specified column(s),
 *     referencing a column in another table
 *
 *     NOTE that you can have multiple constraints of each type on different
 *     columns. Also, the CONSTRAINT keyword is optional, but it can be useful
 *     for giving a name to the constraint.

 * Here is a complete syntax for the INSERT statement in MySQL:

 *
 *     column1, column2, ..., columnN are optional column names to insert data

 *     being inserted.
 *
 *     value1, value2, ..., valueN are the values to insert into the specified

 *
 *     SELECT is a keyword that indicates the values to insert are the result
 *     of a query.

 *     select_statement is a valid SELECT statement that returns the data to be
 *     inserted into the specified table.

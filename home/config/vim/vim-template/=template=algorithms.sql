 *
 *     datatype is the data type of the column

 * 
 *     PRIMARY KEY creates a primary key constraint on the specified column(s)

 *     UNIQUE creates a unique constraint on the specified column(s)
 *
 *     CHECK creates a check constraint on the specified column(s)

 *     FOREIGN KEY creates a foreign key constraint on the specified column(s),
 *     referencing a column in another table
 *
 *     NOTE that you can have multiple constraints of each type on different
 *     columns. Also, the CONSTRAINT keyword is optional, but it can be useful
